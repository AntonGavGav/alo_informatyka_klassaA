Task 1
O(n/4) -> O(n)
Task 2
O(log(n))
Task 3
O(n*(n + log(n))) -> O(n^2+n log(n)) -> O(n^2)
Task 4
O(n^3 +10n) -> O(n^3)
Task 5
O(n^2)
Task 6
O((n^2)/2) -> O(n^2)
Task 7
O( (n/2) * (2+n) ) -> O(n+n^2/2) -> O(n^2)
Task 8
There is a mistake in the task. If in the second loop was intended to be "j" not "i" then the complexity is:
O(n*log(n) + n^2) -> O(n^2)
If it is not the mistake and "i" was intended than:
O(infinity) 
Task 9
O(1)
